# Welcome to 'TheCreativeBud' E-commerce Website

This e-commerce website project is built with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, using Firebase as the backend.

## Getting Started

To start the development server and work on the project locally, follow these steps:

### `npm start`

Runs the website in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically refresh as you make changes.\
Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Testing

You can run tests by executing the following command:

### `npm test`

This command launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information on running tests, refer to our [testing documentation](https://your-ecommerce-website.com/docs/running-tests).

## Building for Production

When you're ready to deploy your e-commerce website, use the following command:

### `npm run build`

This command will build the production-ready website in the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the code and assets for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include unique hashes for cache busting. Your e-commerce website is now ready for deployment!

For more details on deployment, please visit our [deployment documentation](https://your-ecommerce-website.com/docs/deployment).

## Customization and Advanced Configuration

We understand that you may want to customize and configure this project further. To do so, you have full control over the project configuration files, including webpack, Babel, ESLint, and more.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there's no going back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the default configuration, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (like webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project. This gives you complete control over these configurations.

You don't have to use `eject` if you're happy with the default settings. The curated feature set is suitable for small to medium-sized deployments.
